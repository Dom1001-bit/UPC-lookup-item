# Hi there, I'm Dom! 👋

I'm a passionate self-learner diving into the world of software development.

* **👀 I’m interested in:** Software development, app deployment strategies, leveraging AI (like Gemini!) for tool creation, and building applications from the ground up.
* **🌱 I’m currently learning:** The ins and outs of **app deployment**, practical applications of **Gemini for building tools**, and solidifying my foundation by **learning code from scratch**.
* **💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:** Open source projects, tool development, web/app development ideas, or anything interesting where I can contribute, learn, and grow alongside others. If you have a project idea, feel free to reach out!

Feel free to explore my repositories. I'm always looking to learn and improve!
